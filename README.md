# Theme Park

Project for assignment based on a hypothetical travel destination called Theme Park Island. A small private island in K. Atoll. On weekends and special occasions, the island is open for public. Families and friends can book rooms and go to the island via ferry, which is provided free, for customers with valid room booking.

There are also various activities customers can participate in while they are on the island. Booking the tickets for these activities can be done prior to arrival or after, but tickets can only be purchased, after a room has been booked and paid.

The objective of this assignment is to design and develop a website for the theme park to allow customers to book rooms and buy tickets for events.
